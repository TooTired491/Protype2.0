     <h3>Current Mission</h3>
    <p>The Chinese Cultural Center was originally created about 35 years ago by a group of Visalia's Chinese community that came together to build the center as a place to meet and hold event.Even though it is primarily closed and only open to events, it still has an importance in Visalia's community and wasnt to open up to the public again. To share the rich history of the families that immigrated here and came together to build this ornate unique building that stands out from the surrounding.  To preserve and share the rich history of the families that immigrated here and came together to build this ornate unique building, we plan to turn it into a small museum to teach the community about the history and collection of relics.<br><br>We are currently working on catalogging our collection of Chinese antiques and relics for the public to view during their visits. We are also collecting stories from the founding families to share their journey to building the center.</p>
